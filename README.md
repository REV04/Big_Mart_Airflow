# Big_Mart_Airflow
This project, "Big_Mart_Airflow," is part of my Hacktiv8 project on airflow. It serves as both a requirement for my Hacktiv8 studies and a component of my personal portfolio in Data Engineer. You can find my other personal projects on [Richard Edgina Virgo](https://github.com/REV04).

#### -- Project Status: Finished

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to make airflow using apache airflow, data validation using Great Expectation, and data visualization using Kibana. 

### Methods Used
- DDL
- DQL
- Airflow
- DAG

### Technologies

- SQL
- Python
- Kibana
- Apache
## Project Description

The Big Mart dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information about Big Mart products and outlets. The data from Kaggle was transferred to PostgreSQL to simulate data retrieval in a DAG. After this, data cleaning was performed, and the cleaned data was then posted to Elasticsearch. All these processes were executed using Airflow and Docker. Subsequently, data visualization was done using Kibana, and data validation was performed using Great Expectations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. DAG, DDL, and Great Expectation are being kept in Airflow folder
3. Data set raq and clean are being kept in Data Set folder
4. Kibana images visualization are being kept in Images folder
